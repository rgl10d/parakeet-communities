                The term "Mobile Home" or "Trailer" is only used for homes that
                were manufactured in a factory prior to the year 1976. That is
                when the Federal Government set a number of standards in regards
                to the construction of the homes. The proper term for any
                factory built house that is built after 1976, and is based on a
                permanent steel beam structure is "Manufactured Home".

                There are several advantages to buying and living in a
                manufactured home. Probably the biggest advantage is cost. When
                a manufactured home is purchased in a community, the purchaser
                does not need to purchase the land (which is usually the most
                expensive part). The purchaser would buy the home and lease the
                land from the community. The lease fees involved are generally
                less expensive than the costs of purchasing the land. There is
                also a large difference in property taxes. A home located in a
                manufactured home community only pays property taxes on the
                value of the home, not the land. Therefore the monthly taxes
                will be much less than any other type of housing. Manufactured
                homes are perfect for anyone. Whether itâ€™s someone just starting
                out on their own, or the buyers are on a fixed income,
                manufactured housing is a very affordable alternative to
                renting. Another advantage is the wonderful sense of community
                that one gets in a manufactured home community. Our community is
                very friendly, safe, quiet, and clean. Our residents can take
                pride in their home and their home community.

                The answer is "Yes". However, it is very expensive to move a
                mobile or manufactured home. A professional mobile home mover
                would need to be contacted to do the work. Generally the mobile
                home mover is able to disconnect the utilities prior to removing
                the home from the site, but that is determined by the local
                building inspector.
